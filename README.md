# PCOS-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-CNN
Developed a deep learning-based system to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using CNN models. The system analyzes medical x-ray images to classify them as “Infected” or “Non-Infected.” It includes a modern, user-friendly GUI built with CustomTkinter for easy image upload and real-time predictions. 
I have taken dataset from kaggle. It is structured in a way suitable for training and testing a binary classification model. It consists of medical images divided into two categories:
	1.	Infected: Images indicating the presence of PCOS.
	2.	Non-Infected: Images without signs of PCOS.
Training Data is used to train the CNN model.
Testing Data is used to evaluate the model’s performance.
In preprocessing, data augmenttation is used to improve the model
## Model Details
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers for feature extraction and classification.
Activation Functions used are ReLU for convolutional layers and Softmax for the output layer.
Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.001.
Categorical Crossentropy loss function is used.
